            <p>{`Ofer Gavrilov and Harel Sultan,We are (almost) full stack web developers and this is our third project. This project was about making an email and note application, this time we also got to work as 2 partners, which was a great experience, and a lot of fun, even through all the struggles. This projects were made in 4 (long) days, hope you'll enjoy it as much as we had creating it`}</p>
